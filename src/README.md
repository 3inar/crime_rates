This folder holds the code for all the analyses and all the figures in our paper. You should be able to run them directly and reproduce everything if you have the main directory as working directory. Statistics Norway some times changes the names for things. In case this happens and the scripts won't run because the data are on the wrong format, we have provided a backup data set in the `data/` subdirectory here.
